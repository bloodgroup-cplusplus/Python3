Block Confirmations: number of additional blocks after our blocks

Proof of work as a consensus protocol : Proof of work is a piece of overall consensus work


Both equally and very very important



Who is getting these transactions: Miners / Validators ( Pow = Miners ) / (Pos = Validators)



In our example to find the hash that has four zeros at the beginning



Proof of work uses a lot of energy


When a node is paid it is paid in two different ways

The first is using a transaction fees and the other is using the block reward


Transaction Fees: The transaction fee we are going to pay . Blockreward is


Blockreward getting cut into half = Increases the amount of money in transaction


Blockreward and Transaction fees


Gas fees are paid by whoever makes the transaction


Two types of attacks

Sybil Attack: Who bunch of pseudo anonymous attacks to create more

when single nodes try to create more amount of nodes by carrying out transaction

51% attack : the 51%

The longest chain rule : the new nodes will follow the longest chain


Different longest chain fits it on and 51% of the network and

ETH classic is not ETH . (ETH is forked of eth classic)

Proof of work helps us to protect against symbil attack

Proff of Work uses a lot of energy


Proof of Stake (POS) protocol are thriving (avalache, solana, polkadot)

Eth2 has proof of stake

all the tools are going to work in eth2

Proof of stake nodes put up collateral as as sybil


Proof of stake requires putting some eth coins on the stake and in case the miners acts maliciously their stake is taken away from them

For mining each node we need to put some eth on stake  and if we misbehave we loose the amount


in pos mining is called Validators
In pos nodes are randomly choosen and rest of the node verify


Randomness: Blockchains are determinnistic system. How do we choose random validotrs
in Eth2.0 they use

Randomness solutions of blockchain


Proof of stake: uses less energy, good way to figure out author

Cons: Slightly less decentralized network  (how decentralized is decentralized enough)

Proof of stake is very decentralized and very secure

reduces environmental problems by 99 percent


Scalability: When a lot of people want to use blockchains the gas price sky rockets. This is not scalable . When more and more poeple want to use blockchain, it is going to cost them a lot of money


It is going to cost more and more to used the blockchain .

Eht2.0 also implements sharding which is a solution to scalability problem

A blockchain of blockchain

There is more chain for people to make transactions on

Sharding can help transactions

Layer1: Base Layer blockchan implementtaion ( base layer blockchain solutions)

Layer 2: Any application built on top of a layer 2 ( chainlink , arbitrium)


Arbirium and Optimum are Rollups : rollups their transaction to

Rollups: derive security from base layers



SUMMARY:

ETH and BTC are Proof of Work ( at the time of recording ) that follow nakamoto consensus however
eth2.0 will be proof of stake sharded blockchains

51%percent attacks

sharding and rollups are scabliby solutions


Only so many transactions can fit into the block


Gas price are how much it costs to make the transactions in a blockchain.
