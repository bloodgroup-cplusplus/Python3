onsensus:
        Proof of work and Proof of stake fall under the umbrella of consensus

Hashing/ Hash Function

Node: A single instance in a decentralized network

Anyone can join the network ( decentralized) and participate and that is what it makes it truly decentralized

If a centralized entity goes down it goes down

Blockchain are resilient : If one node goes down it does not matter .

Most of the popular chains have thousands and thousands of nodes

If one node acts maliciously it will be dismissed by other nodes

Majority rules

Blockchain nodes keep lists of the transactions that occur

Blockchain has immutability

blockchain = decentralized database

Ethereum = decentralized database + computational work





Consensus : Is the mechanism used to agree on the state of the blockchain

Proof of work = Mininig

Consensus is the mechanism used ot agree on the state of a blockchain


Consensus :
                1) Chain Selection Algorithm 2) Sybil Resistence Alogrithm

                2) Proof of work is sybil resitsenc mechanism . Which nodes did the work to find the mine so that other nodes can verify who did the work

                Sybil Resistence : Is a way of blocks to verify pseudo anonymous identities and influence over system . It is a defense mechansim shown by blockchain
                against some malicious people who keep on creating or adding nodes to the required blockchain..


POW and POS : Proof of Work and Proof of Stake :

        Proof of Work : A single node has to go through a very computationally intensive work known as mining to finding the correct nonce
        no matter how many pseudoanonymous nodes we make, each one has to go through this very activites involving verificaion of finding answer to the proof of work
        finding nonce with first four zeros

        Block time: How much time it takes for a block to be published and it is proportional to how hard these algorithms are . So these problems change

        If the system wants block time to be very long the work is very hard (computatiion intensive)




If one chain does somethihng and others don't the block will be dismissed


Block-time: How long the time on a block is spent while doing computations

Consensus :
                1) Chain Selection : How do we know which blockchain is the true blockchain . (Merkle Trees)
                On bitcoin and ethereum use Nakamoto consensus

                2) Whichever block has the longest chain is the one which has done most work


                3) Number of  block confirmations is number of block added after we did the transactions


                4) Proof of work is the piece of overall consensus


                5) Nakamoto consensus is the actual


                6) Proof of work is a piece of consensus protocl


Proof of work tells where these fees and transactions fees go to

Transactions fees goes to miners ( pow) and validatiors( pos)

Pow = All blocks are competing against each other to get the answer first

The first node to figure out the answer gets the transaction fee

The pow is energy intensive

Transaction Fees: The gas required to carry out our transaction
