Hash:
        A unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. They are crated by placind said data into a "hash function"


They have to find out

Nonce is the solution to the problem


The key idea is to find a nonce that fulfills the Hash


Elliptic Cruve cryptography to get the public private key


PUblic key is publicly available to all users whereas private key is private to you


Generation of public-private keys requires elliptic key cryptography

We can create message signature with our private key but somebody else cannot derive our private key via the message signature

Private-Key : Used to sign message signatures

Public-key : Used to verify message signatures


Using public -keys anyone can verify the signature is yours

so no one can fake a transaction



SUMMARY:

PUBLIC-KEY :    Is derived from your private key. Anyone can use your public key to verify the transactions


SIGNING A TRANSACTION: A "one way" process. Someone with a private key signs a transaction by their private key being
being hashed with their transaction data

Anyone can then verify this new transaction hash with your public key.


Private Key ||||| >Creates Public Key creates Address


Blockchain run on pair of different independent users

Node: A single instance in a  decentralized network

One server running this technology

Anyone can join the network

(Decentralized)


Applications are usually run by centralized entities : They control everythin


Blockchain are resilient : If one node goes down we make sure one chain is always running

If one node acts maliciously they can easily be dismissed

Each blockchain nodes keep lists of the transacitons that occur

This give blockchain gives immutability chain

Blockchain is a decentralized database
