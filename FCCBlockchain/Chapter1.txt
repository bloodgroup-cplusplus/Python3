estnets are free and for testing smart contracts
Mainnet costs money and are considered "live"

All the above jargons are related to metamask wallet

faucet.rinkbey.io // for simulating test ethereum transactions

Faucet:
        Is an application that gives us free test tokens, like free test Rinkeby Ethereum


Etherscans is also known as blockexplorer


BlockExplorer:
        An application that allows us to "view" transactions that happen on a blockchain.




GAS:
        Gas is a unit of computational measure. The more computation a transaction uses
        the more "gas" you have to pay for


        Every transaction that happens on-chain pays a "gass fee" to the node operators



Any time you do something on a blockchain it costs gas


The amount of "gas" used and how much you pay depends on how "computationally expensive" your transaction is


Sending ETH to 1 address would be "cheaper" than sending ETH to 1,000 addresses


The gas limit 0.00000000000000001 (1 gwei) for gas fees


Gas : Measure of Computation Use

Gas Price: How much it costs per unit of gas


Gas Limit : Max amount of gas in transaction



Transaction Fee: Gas Used * Gas Price


i.e.: 21000 gas @ 1 GWEI per gas = 21,000 21,000 GWEI


Why pay higher gas fees: Since there are a large amount of transactions going on in the blockchain therefore if we pay higher amount of gas fees it is very likely that our transactions will be given high priority

A gas station is a gas estimator

Gas price is based off the "demand" of the blockchain


The more poeple want to make transactions, the higher the gas price, and therefore the higher the transaction fees.
