coin used to make p2p transaction in decentralized network

Bitcion
        # Digital Store of Value
        # Digital Gold
        # Bitcion has a scarce Quantity
        # Read more about it in the white paper



Ethereum

        # protocol using same blockchain infrastrcutre
        # smart contracts allow for agreements without centralized intermedaries
        # Bitcoins + Adding smart contracts

        # Smart Contracts are self executing sets of instructions, they come to life on the blockchain

        # smart contracts are similar to regular contracts but it is written in code
        # terms of agreeement are written in code and executed by the decentralized blockchain

        # Bitcoin also does have smart contract but its very limited unlike ethereum

        # Utility for people to build smart contracts
        # Nickszabo was the pioneer of smart contracts (the idea)



The oracle Problem(fatal flaw)
        # blockchain are deterministic

        # Everything happens inside in a black box
        # Smart contracts need real world data
        # this is where orcles come to play
        # Smart contracts need to import export data to internal or external for carrying out computations

        # Blockchains and smart contracts are decentralized
        # inorder to stay decentralized we also needs computations and data decentralized
        # so we build hybrid smart contract
        # chainlink is decentralized oracle data that helps us to bring data to the blocchain etc
        # chainlinks allows for unlimited amount of activities in decentralized manner
        #Smart contracts come to life on blockchain
        # Blockchain oracles such as chain link does the idea of
        # Bitcoin networks has assets
        # Etheruem viewed them as
        # Hybrid = smartcontract + offchain smart contract
        #DApp == smartcontract == decentralized application
        #What is a singular contract
        # Ethereum protocol has given rise to defi nfts daos layers2 etc
        # other protocols have taken
        #vision of ethereum is similairt to polygon etc
        #ethereum is the fundamentals
        # learning fundamentals will translate to any other blockchain
        #ethereum is most used smart contract platform/ protocol
        #chainlink is most powerful oracle network
        # chinlink works on polygon polkadot ethereum or any other blockchain

SUMMARY
# Bitcion is a digital gold
# Ethereuem allows for smart contracts
# code with smart contracts
#chainlink provides data and external computation to smart contracts
# combination of on-chain and off-chain components
# Advantages of blockchan and smart contracts


        # Decentralized : no centralized source that control the blockchain
        # node operators are independent blockchain
        # blockchain is here to solve the centralized authority problem
        # freeze your funds
        # control your interaction with the system



        #Transparency and Flexibility : No backdoor deals
        # everything is transparent
        # Everyone can see what exactly those rules
        # Blockchain is pseudo anonymous


        # Speed and Efficiency: Blockchains are verified by decentralized components
        # Stock trading or hedge fund world takes week to buy/sell stock


        #SEcurity and Immutability: cannot be changed and massive change in data etc.

        # On a blockchain if several nodes goes down cause as long as there is one node running
        # everything that happens is irreversible
        #hacking is not possible
        # asset is locked on a blockchain
        # to access the asset we just need the private key


        # Removal of Massive counterparty risk:
                # This agreement is a massive conflict of interest
                # e.g., insurance provideers for health emergencies
                # insurance companies are in the business of making money
                # they are the ones who are going to execute something
                # wasting time going through baseless arguments


# Trust Minimized Agreements:
                # smart contracts allows us to move from brand based agreements to math based agreements

                # code determines the input output and it is same every single time


        # Allows to work in environment wherethere is no centralized controlling body


# economic opportunity
# we no longer get bombarded by centralized authority to use their servicees



Blockchain and Smart contracts

1)Decentralized
2) Transparent
3) Speed
4) Immutable
5) Remove Coutnerparty Risk ( smart contract)
6) Allow for trust minimized agreements
7) Paired with oracle to get data from world to bring data and computation from external world

8) DAOs are ones which live in decentralized chains
